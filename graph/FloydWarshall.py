    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Multi-source shortest path problem (all-pairs shortest paths)

    finding the shortest paths from K multiple source nodes to a single destination node or to all other nodes 
    in a weighted digraph without negative cycles 

    for a graph with negative cycle, those vertices that are not reachable from the negative cycle, can still have valid shortest paths

    input
        a weighted digraph without negative cycles G=(V, E)
        a set of source vertices S âŠ† V 
    output
        a set of V^2 shortest path d(v) and corresponding weights
        a path may not exist due to reachability or negative cycle
