"""
    Naive Dijkstra's algorithm for Single-source shortest path problem 

    T: O(V^2)  two nested loops
    S: O(V+E)  adjacency list 
    
    only applied to graph with positive weights
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Variants of Dijkstra's algorithm:
    
    Naive Dijkstra: no heap
    standard Dijkstra: heap optimized, enqueue AFTER updating the distance
    Lazy Dijkstra: heap optimized, enqueue BEFORE updating the distance
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Greedy algorithm:

    1. Initialization: start with a source vertex,
     
                       set the shortest distance to itself as 0 and to all other vertices as infinity.

                       mark all vertices as unvisited. (NOTE: don't mark source vertex as visited)

    2. Selection: Out of unvisited vertices, pick the one with the smallest known distance

                  mark the selected vertex as visited

                  A visited vertex will not be checked again; its shortest distance from the source is final and minimal.

    3. Relaxation: for the selected vertex, examine it's unvisited neighbors (distance infinity)
    
                  If find a shorter path to a neighbor via the current vertex, we update the distance.

    4. Repetition: repeat steps 2-3 until all vertices are visited/settled, 
    
        i.e., their shortest paths from the source have been permanently determined.
    
    All the vertices are divided into 2 sets
    S1 shortest path is solved
    S2 (heap) shortest path is unsolved
